       <h2>History</h2>
       <div class="era">
           <h3>Origins and Early Years (1920s-1930s)</h3>
           <p>The Esperanza Carnival began in the early 1920s as a small community fair in the heart of Central Valley, California.
               Initially, it was a modest harvest festival organized by local farmers to celebrate the end of the agricultural season.
               The event featured homemade food stands, local crafts, and live music, providing a space for the community to come together and share the fruits of their labor.

           <h3>Growth and Development (1940s-1960s)</h3>
           <p>As the culture grew, so did the carnival.
               Post-World War II, the festival expanded to include a wider range of activities.
               The introduction of carnival rides in the late 1940s was a significant milestone, transforming it from a local fair into a more prominent event.
               The 1950s and 1960s saw the addition of parades, beauty pageants, and larger musical acts, drawing visitors from neighboring towns and cities.

               Technology advancements have brought about more thrilling rides, state-of-the-art stage setups for concerts, and a significant online presence.
